Applying the same analysis for commands but diving deeper into structure I analyzed states as well:

But this time it was important to analyze the Data part as well.

Most part, the packets have matched the Delta structure, present in hassio-ecoflow: https://github.com/vwt12eh8/hassio-ecoflow/blob/main/custom_components/ecoflow/ecoflow/receive.py

All present packets are (2, 32, 2) that are PD module packets and can be parsed using `parse_pd_delta`.

In my experience, you can also receive following type of packets:

```
(2, 32, 2) -> pd (len: 123)
(3, 32, 2) -> ems (len: 46)
(3, 32, 50) -> bms (len: 69) - primary battery
(4, 32, 2) -> inv (len: 70)
(5, 32, 2) -> mppt (len: 94)
(6, 32, 50) -> bms (len: 69) - extra battery
```

And mostly their structure matches with some quirks and extra tails.
